# Breast Cancer Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)" dataset. The analysis is performed using R Markdown.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)" dataset, which is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about various features of cell nuclei extracted from digitized images of breast mass aspirates. The goal of the analysis is to predict whether a given breast mass is benign or malignant.

## Files

- `analysis.Rmd`: This is the R Markdown file that contains the code and narrative for the analysis.
- `analysis.html`: This is the rendered HTML output of the R Markdown analysis.
- `cancer.csv`: The dataset file in CSV format.

## How to Run the Analysis

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have R and RStudio installed.
3. Open the `analysis.Rmd` file in RStudio.
4. Install the required packages mentioned in the R Markdown file, if necessary.
5. Knit the R Markdown file to generate the HTML output.

The generated `analysis.html` file will contain the results, visualizations, and interpretation of the analysis.
